      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.<br>
        <p>In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the browser's default styles — very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>

      <h2>What is CSS for?</h2>
      <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.<br>

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.<br>

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.<br>
      CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
      <h2>CSS syntax</h2>
      <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."<br>
      The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
      <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
    </body>

      Getting Started With CSS
        </header>
      <p>In this article we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical things about the language along the way.</p>
      <h2>Starting with some HTML</h2>
      <p>Our starting point is an HTML document. You can copy the code from below if you want to work on your own computer. Save the code below as </kbd>index.html<kbd> in a folder on your machine.</p>
      <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      &lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title>Getting started with CSS&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;I am a level one heading&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a &lt;span>span element&lt;/span&gt;
and also a &lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph. It contains an &lt;em>emphasized&lt;/em&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;span>one&lt;/lt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em>three&lt;/em>&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
        <h2>Adding CSS to our document</h2>
        <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
        <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <kbd>styles.css.</kbd> The <kbd>.css</kbd> extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
        <p>To link <kbd>styles.css</kbd> to <kbd>index.html</kbd> add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
      </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
      <p>This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the <kbd>rel</kbd> attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the <kbd>href</kbd> attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to <kbd>styles.css.</kbd> Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>
        <div id="div-code">
        <pre>
        <code>
        h1 {
  color: red;
}
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
        <p>You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>
        <h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>
        <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>
        <div id="div-code">
        <pre>
        <code>
        p {
  color: green;
}
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
        <div id="div-code">
        <pre>
        <code>
        p, li {
    color: green;
}
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
      
      <!--- How CSS is structured  -->
   
      <hr>
      <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_Is_Structured">
    <header>How CSS Is Structured</header>
      <p>Now that you are beginning to understand the purpose and use of CSS, let's examine the structure of CSS.</p>
      <h2>Applying CSS to HTML</h2>
      <p>First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.</p>
      <h2>External stylesheet</h2>
      <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a <kbd>.css</kbd> extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.</p>
      <p>You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML &lt;link&gt; element:</p>
        <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The CSS stylesheet file might look like this:</p>
      <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      h1 {
  color: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The <kbd>href</kbd> attribute of the &lt;link&gt; element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the example above, the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it somewhere else and adjust the path. Here are three examples:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
    <pre>
    <code>
    %lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called styles inside the current directory --%gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"&gt;

&lt;!-- Inside a subdirectory called general, which is in a subdirectory called styles, inside the current directory --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/general/style.css"&gt;

&lt;!-- Go up one directory level, then inside a subdirectory called styles --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css"&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <h2>Internal stylesheet</h2>
      <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&ht;.</p>
      <p>The HTML for an internal stylesheet might look like this:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      p {
        color: red;
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1>Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p>This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.</p>
      <p>But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way of working. To apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must have an internal stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. The efficiency penalty carries over to site maintenance too. With CSS in internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one simple styling change may require edits to multiple web pages.</p>
      <h2>Inline styles</h2>
      <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a <kbd>style</kbd> attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;">Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p style="color:red;">This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.</p>
      <p>There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.</p>
  
  
<!-- How CSS Works -->  
  
  <hr>
<section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_Works">
  <header>How CSS Works</header>
      <p>We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for and how to write simple stylesheets. In this lesson we will take a look at how a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.
      <h2>How does CSS actually work?</h2>
      <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
        <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
        <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.</li>
        <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>
        <li>The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.</li>
        <li>The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).</li>
  </ul>
        <h2>About the DOM</h2>
        <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
        <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.</p>
        <h2>A real DOM representation</h2>
        <p>Rather than a long, boring explanation, let's look at an example to see how a real HTML snippet is converted into a DOM.</p>
        <p>Take the following HTML code:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
        <pre>
        <code>
        &lt;p&gt;
  Let's use:
  &lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>In the DOM, the node corresponding to our <kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd> element is a parent. Its children are a text node and the three nodes corresponding to our <kbd>&lt;span&gt;</kbd> elements. The <kbd>SPAN</kbd> nodes are also parents, with text nodes as their children:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
    <pre>
    <code>
    P
├─ "Let's use:"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Cascading"
├─ SPAN
|  └─ "Style"
└─ SPAN
    └─ "Sheets"
    </code>
    </pre>
        </div>
        <p>This is how a browser interprets the previous HTML snippet —it renders the above DOM tree and then outputs it in the browser like so:</p>
        <pre>
        Let's use: Cascading Style Sheets
        </pre>
        <h2>Applying CSS to the DOM</h2>
        <p>Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the HTML is as follows:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
        <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;p&gt;
  Let's use:
  &lt;span&gt;Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Style&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
</p>
</code>
</pre>
        </div>
      <p>Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:</p>
    <div id="div-code">
      <pre>
      <code>
      span {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: lime;
}
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a <kbs>span</kbd> selector, the browser will be able to sort the CSS very quickly! It will apply that rule to each one of the three <kbd>&lg;span&gt;</kbd>s, then paint the final visual representation to the screen.</p>
      <p>The updated output is as follows:</p>
         <div id="div-code">
          <pre>
          <code>
          &lt;p&gt;
  Let's use:
  &lt;span>Cascading&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span>Style&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span>Sheets&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      </div>
 <p>In our Debugging CSS article in the next module we will be using browser DevTools to debug CSS problems, and will learn more about how the browser interprets CSS.</p>
  <!--- Using your new knowledge -->
        <hr>
  <section class="main-section" id="Using_Your_New_knowledge">
    <header>Using Your New Knowledge</header>
      <p>With the things you have learned in the last few lessons you should find that you can format simple text documents using CSS to add your own style to them. This assessment gives you a chance to do that.</p>
      <h2>Starting point</h2>
      <p>You can work in the live editor below, or you can download the starting point file to work with in your own editor. This is a single page containing both the HTML and the starting point CSS (in the head of the document). If you prefer you could move this CSS to a separate file when you create the example on your local computer. Alternatively use an online tool such as CodePen, jsFiddle, or Glitch to work on the tasks.</p>
      <h2>Working with CSS</h2>
      <p>The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that I have used are as follows — each one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more examples of its use.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>font-family</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>color</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>color</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>font-weight</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>font-size</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>font-style</kbd></li>
        <li><kbd>text-decoration</kbd></li>
     
        <p>In the box below, you will find some CSS already in place. This selects parts of the document using element selectors, classes, and pseudo-classes. Make the following changes to this CSS:</p>
        <ul>
          <il>Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword <kbd>hotpink</kbd>.</il>
          <il>Give the heading a 10px dotted <kbd>border-bottom</kbd> which uses the CSS color keyword <kbd>purple</kbd>.</il>
          <il>Make the level 2 heading italic.</il>
          <il>Give the <kbd>ul</kbd> used for the contact details a <kbd>background-color</kbd> of <kbd>#eeeeee</kbd>, and a 5px solid purple <kbd>border</kbd>. Use some <kbd>padding</kbd> to push the content away from the border.</il>
          <il>Make the links <kbd>green</kbd> on hover.</il>
          
          <p>You should end up with something like this image.</p>
          <!--AÑADIR IMAGEN-->
